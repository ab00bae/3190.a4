# Assignment 4: Fun with Languages (30%)

Choose one of the two following topics.

Requirements for the assignment are specified at the end of each topic.

## 1. Chess Armies of Queens

In chess, a queen attacks positions from where it is, in straight lines up-down and left-right as well as on both its diagonals. It attacks only pieces not of its own colour. The goal of Peaceful Armies of Queens is to arrange `m` black queens and `m` white queens on an `n`-by-`n` square grid (the board), so that no queen attacks another of a different colour.

Here are three examples:
- `m=1, n=3`
- `m=4, n=5`
- `m=5, n=6`

The earliest known reference to this problem was by Stephen Ainley in his 1977 book *Mathematical Puzzles*. Ainley found layouts for square chessboards up to size `30×30`.

### Task

Design and implement an Ada program, `queenarmies.adb`, to represent two-colour queen armies on a 2-D board.

- Create an algorithm to generate at least two solutions to placing `m` equal numbers of black and white queens on an `n` square board. The program should work for `m` up to a value of `4` and `n` up to a value of `10`.
- Include appropriate functionality to decide whether the inputs are valid. For example, `m=3` and `n=3` is not possible.
- Allow the user to input the values `m` and `n`, and output the result generated in the form of a graphic.
- The visualization should be intuitive. You can choose to use standard ASCII characters or Unicode chess pieces. The quality of visualization will be reflected in the rubric.
- The code for the visualization should exist in an Ada package: `showboard.adb`.

## 2. Unbounded Integers

The problem with integers is that they are bounded, making it difficult to calculate large factorials or higher Fibonacci numbers. Unbounded arithmetic operations are quite important in modern mathematical languages like Matlab, Mathematica, and Maple. These systems represent unbounded signed integers as linked lists of machine-size integers.

For example, consider the following series from the Factorial:
```
18! = 6402373705728000
19! = 121645100408832000
20! = 2432902008176640000
21! = -4249290049419214848  # Overflow occurs
```
Using a linked list would allow large numbers to be stored and manipulated efficiently.

### Task

Design and implement a Fortran program, `unbounded.f03`, to handle unbounded integers.

- The program should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Verify that the input contains only valid digits and signs.
- Store numbers using a dynamic linked list, provided in the module `dynllist.f03`.
- Implement a user interface for input and output.
- Implement factorial calculation up to `42!` and display the full result.

### User Interface Example
```
> Enter an operation: + - * / or !
